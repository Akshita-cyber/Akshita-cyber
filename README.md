### Hi there, I'm Akshita 👋

I'm a web enthusiast who loves building meaningful and functional applications. I enjoy exploring Java and JavaScript, and I'm always curious to learn how things work behind the scenes — whether it's frontend interfaces or backend logic.

Currently, I'm focusing on improving my development skills and contributing to real-world projects. You'll often find me experimenting with ideas, working on code, or diving into documentation (and occasionally getting lost in a good debug session).

- 💻 Tech Stack: Java | JavaScript | HTML | CSS | Tailwind CSS | NodeJS
- 🌱 Currently Learning: Web app development, design patterns, and clean coding
- 🔍 Exploring: Open source and side projects
- 🧠 Believer in: Learning by doing
